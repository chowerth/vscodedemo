The purpose of this folder is to test out the julia server extensions for VSCode
I'm following the "Using VSCode for Julia" youtube video

So far it's an okay impression. It's very slow to load and takes a long time to index packages. However, once it's loaded it's quick.

1. To run a line in your code have your cursor on the line and press alt+enter
2. You can view global variables in the julia server workspace section and get detailed tables and data type info
3. the 'ans' variable holds the values of the last executed command
